# DoltCoin

We are developing DoltCoin ($DOLT), a very simple crypto-currency, powered by [Dolt](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt) as backing database. [Here](https://dev.to/buhrmi/dolt-as-a-backing-database-for-blockchains-1ba4) you can read about the initial motivation for the project.

The goal of DoltCoin is to stay simple, so that new programmers can easily join the project. 

DoltCoin will start off as a proof-of-work blockchain and automatically switch over to proof-of-stake once a specific block height is reached.

## Get started

Project is under development, check back later.

### Roadmap:

- 1.0: Stable Public Network
