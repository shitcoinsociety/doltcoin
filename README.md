# DoltCoin

The blockchain for simple people.

DoltCoin ($DOLT) is an upcoming crypto-currency utilizing [Dolt](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt) as its backing database. You can read more about the motivation behind DoltCoin [here](https://dev.to/buhrmi/dolt-as-a-backing-database-for-blockchains-1ba4).

The goal of DoltCoin is to stay simple, so that new programmers can easily join the project. 

DoltCoin will start off as a proof-of-work blockchain and automatically switch over to proof-of-stake once a specific block height is reached.

### Roadmap:

- 1.0: Stable Public Network
- 2.0: DoltVM & Smart Contracts
