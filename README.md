# DoltCoin

We are developing DoltCoin ($DOLT), a very simple crypto-currency, powered by [Dolt](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt).

The goal of DoltCoin is to stay simple, so that new programmers can easily join the project.

DoltCoin will start off as a proof-of-work blockchain and automatically switch over to proof-of-stake once a specific block height is reached.

## Get started

Project is under development, check back later.

### Roadmap:

- 1.0: Stable Public Network
- 2.0: DoltVM & Smart Contracts
